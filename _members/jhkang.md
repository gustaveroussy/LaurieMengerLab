Jinhong joined Laurie Menger’s laboratory at Gustave Roussy as a postdoctoral researcher in September 2025. She earned her PhD from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz / Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, where she investigated how adjuvant- and anti-inflammatory drug–loaded nanoparticles modulate immune cells and evaluated their potential as immunotherapies. At Gustave Roussy, she develops drug-conjugated antibodies and nanobodies to dissect and enhance T-cell stemness. In parallel, she is working to overcome limitations of GD2 CAR-T therapy in pediatric high-risk neuroblastoma by leveraging patient-derived iPSC-derived GD2 CAR-macrophages, in collaboration with Florent Ginhoux’s lab.
