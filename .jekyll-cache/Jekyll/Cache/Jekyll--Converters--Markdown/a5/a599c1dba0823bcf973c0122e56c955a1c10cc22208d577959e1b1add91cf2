<p>In vivo genome-wide CRISPR screens in primary T cells allow the systematic and unbiased identification of non-redundant regulatory mechanisms shaping immune responses. Here, we present an optimized protocol for efficient generation of a pool of genome-wide inactivated Cas9-expressing T cells using a retroviral library of sgRNA.
