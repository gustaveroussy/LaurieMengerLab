<p>Allogeneic chimaeric antigen receptor T cells (allo-CAR T cells) derived from healthy donors could provide rapid access to standardized and affordable batches of therapeutic cells if their rejection by the hostâ€™s immune system is avoided. Here, by means of an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen, we show that the deletion of Fas or B2m in allo- T cells increases their survival in immunocompetent mice.

<p>In vivo genome-wide CRISPR screens in primary T cells allow the systematic and unbiased identification of non-redundant regulatory mechanisms shaping immune responses. Here, we present an optimized protocol for efficient generation of a pool of genome-wide inactivated Cas9-expressing T cells using a retroviral library of sgRNA.

<p>Using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens and an in vivo system modeling of antigen-experienced CD4+ T cell recruitment and proliferation during a localized immune response, we identified suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) as a major nonredundant checkpoint imposing a brake on CD4+ T cell proliferation.
