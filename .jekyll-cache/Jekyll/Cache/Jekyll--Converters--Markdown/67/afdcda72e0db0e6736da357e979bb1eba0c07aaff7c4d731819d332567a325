I"´<p>Aurelien Sutra Del Galy, MD, PhD, is a physician specializing in hematology and bone marrow transplantation. He trained in Gerard SociÃ©â€™s team at Saint Louis Hospital in Paris. Leveraging his bioinformatics expertise, he contributed to the discovery of SOCS1 as a critical internal checkpoint inhibitor of CD4 T cells. He also played a role in elucidating the function of FAS in preventing the rejection of allogeneic CAR T cells. For his PhD at the Curie Institute, supervised by Sebastian Amigorena, he studied how alternative splice junctions and transposable elements can lead to tumor-specific neopeptides, which may serve as targets for cellular and antibody-based therapies.</p>
