I"–	<p>Chuang has always enjoyed working at the interface of three disciplines: Biology, Informatics and Mathematics. He holds a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Biochemistry and Molecular biology and a Master‚Äôs Degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. His Master‚Äôs Degree trained him to access engineering positions in bioinformatics. Previously, He has worked at the National Center of Human Genomics Research as a bioinformatician in the Laboratory for Epigenetics and Environment under the supervision of Dr. J√∂rg Tost dates 2017-2018. Since 2019, he joined Pierre Milpied‚Äôs team at the Marseille Luminy Immunology Center (CIML) as a bioinformatics engineer. His work focused on the analysis of single cell and spatial transcriptomics to characterize three axes of B cell biology: Germinal Center biology, Lymphomas and Tumor-infiltrating B cells. At the beginning of 2025, he joined our team as a bioinformatics specialist to develop a project ‚ÄúEpigenetic and epitranscritomic regulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and CAR-T cells‚Äù. His work aims at 1/ exploring the therapeutic potential of agents and genome editing in cell therapy and 2/providing proof of concept for targeting these factors ex vivo using omics data.</p>
