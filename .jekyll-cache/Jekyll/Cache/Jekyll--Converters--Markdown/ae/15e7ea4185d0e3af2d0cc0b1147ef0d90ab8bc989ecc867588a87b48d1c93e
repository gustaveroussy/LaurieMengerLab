I"<p>Marguerite is a PhD student specializing in cancer immunotherapies. Her research aims to explore innovative strategies for the translational development of T cell therapies, with a focus on enhancing T cell metabolism and overcoming resistance posed by immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments. She conducts genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify key target genes that limit adoptive T cell fitness, persistence, and efficacy. Through her expertise in gene editing and T cell engineering, she seeks to advance cellular therapies for broader application in patients, particularly those with solid tumors.</p>

<p>Marguerite holds a PharmD from Université de Caen Normandie and a Master’s in Biotechnology from Université de Grenoble and Grenoble Ecole de Management.</p>
