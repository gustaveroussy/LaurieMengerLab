<p>Allogeneic chimaeric antigen receptor T cells (allo-CAR T cells) derived from healthy donors could provide rapid access to standardized and affordable batches of therapeutic cells if their rejection by the hostâ€™s immune system is avoided. Here, by means of an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen, we show that the deletion of Fas or B2m in allo- T cells increases their survival in immunocompetent mice.
