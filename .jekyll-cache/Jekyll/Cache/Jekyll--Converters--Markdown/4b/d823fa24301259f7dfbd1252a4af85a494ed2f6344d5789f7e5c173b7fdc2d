<p>Our work focuses on the study of T cells biology in immunosuppressive environments through systematic and unbiased approaches to accelerate immunotherapeutic targets discovery. Our goal is to characterize the genes and essential parameters for the development of synthetic immunology providing a new class of effective, safe and affordable treatments for oncology.</p>
